## Requirements

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

        composer require studioespresso/easyaddressfield

## Settings

### Google Maps API
To enable geolocating and custom marker placement, you need to provide a Google Maps API key.
1) Sign in to [Google's developers console](http://console.developers.google.com/)
2) Create a new project
3) Enable the `Google Maps Geocoding API` and the `Google Static Maps API`

**üö® Important üö®**
Google's Geocoding API does not support HTTP referrer restrictions. Make sure the API key you are using this not have these set.

#### API Errors
When `devMode` is enabled, any errors returned by Google's API will show an exception so you can clearly see what's going wrong. With `devMode` disabled, any errors will be logged to Craft's `web.log`.
This is an example of the exception you'll see when your API key has HTTP referers set.

- Default marker color
- Default marker icon

## Template variables

### Static map

The plugin makes it easy to render a static map image based on 1 or more address fields.

#### Available functions

`craft.address.getStaticMap`: returns an `<img src` element of the static map image (needs to be followed by the `|raw` filter to show the image)

`craft.address.getStaticMapRaw`: returns a link to the static map image, which you can use how you like yourself.

`craft.address.getDirectionsUrl`: get a directions link to the given address

#### Usage

`{{ craft.address.getStaticMap(entry.addressFieldHandle) }}`

To include multiple address fields in the static map, add them as an array:

`{{ craft.address.getStaticMap([entry.addressFieldHandle, entry.addressFieldHandle2 ]) }}`

#### Available settings

- **data** (the field or fields to use)
- **zoom** (the zoom level, integer between `0` & `21`)
- **size** (widthxheight, defaults to `640x640` which is also the maximum size)
- **style** (name of the style the map should be using, falls back to the style set in settings)
- **color** (hex value to be used as color for the marker(s), fallback to the color set in settings)
- **icon** (url that should be used as icon for the marker(s))
- **scale** (the scale level of the image, integer, `1` or `2`)


#### Examples:

1) Static map with default options:
`{{ craft.address.getStaticMap(entry.addressField)|raw }}`
